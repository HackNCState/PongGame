# PongGame
A simple pong game tutorial to introduce python to beginner programmers. This tutorial is adapted from the Python Learning series on freeCodeCamp.org. The intro to python syntactical section was adapted from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). It is a brilliant resource for further reading in Python and a myriad of other programming languages and concepts.

## Install Python
PackHacks Hacker Guide: [How to install Python](https://www.notion.so/Hacker-Resources-cb0b84f22831494fb174571c065f502c#03d184ea17834231b0cc88b834352b0a)

## Install a Text Editor
Although any text editor will technically work, I'd recommend one that has some tools to help us write python.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source code editor created by Microsoft.
It's the editor I use throughout the tutorial.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text editor developed by GitHub.
You can install a package like [atom-beaufity](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) to help format your code.
